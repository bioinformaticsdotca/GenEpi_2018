## Introduction

This tutorial aims to introduce a variety of software and concepts related to detecting emerging pathogens from a complex host sample. Each exercise will demonstrate some of the concepts in current routine use and hopefully be applied to future applications.

All datasets have been modified to either illustrate a specific learning objective or to reduce the complexity of the problem. Contamination and a lack of large and accurate databases render detection of microbial pathogens difficult. As a disclaimer, all results produced from the tools described in this tutorial and others must also be verified with supplementary bioinformatics or wet-laboratory techniques.

## Exercise 1

### Patient Background:

On April 27, a 66-year old male was admitted to a local ER. He presented with fever, headache, and vomiting but soon after admission to the ER presented with internal bleeding. CBC revealed elevated white blood cell count, neutrophils, etc. The hospital epidemiologist was consulted to confirm the clinician's findings. 

### Demonstration:

* Filter host reads with KAT
* Run Kraken with small bacteria and viral database
* Generate text and graphic reports with Kraken and Krona

---

### Step 1: Host read filtering

The first step in this demonstration is to remove the host reads from the dataset prior to downstream analysis. There are several different tools that can be used to filter out host reads such as Kraken, BLAST, KAT and others. In this demonstration, we have selected KAT because of the smaller memory requirement compared to Kraken and relatively quick speed.

Command documentation is available [here](http://kat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using.html#sequence-filtering)

KAT works by breaking down each read into k-mers fragments of length 27 and comparing them to a k-mer database of human reference genomes. Subsequently, the complete read is either assigned into a matched or unmatched file(s) if 10% of the k-mers in the read have been found in the human database. 

<img src="https://github.com/bioinformaticsdotca/Genomic_Epi_2017/blob/master/module6/images/kat.png?raw=true" alt="KAT" width="750" />  

```bash
cd ~/workspace/module6_exercises/ex1

kat filter seq -i -o unmatched --seq ex1_1.fastq --seq2 ex1_2.fastq ~/CourseData/IDGE_data/module6/kat_db/human_kmers.jf
```

#### Command arguments:

* `--seq --seq2` arguments to provide corresponding forward and reverse fastq reads
* `-i` whether to output sequences not found in the kmer hash, rather than those with a database hit (host sequences). 
* `-o unmatched` Provide prefix for all files generated by the command. In our case, we will have two output files **unmatched.in.R1.fastq** and **unmatched.in.R2.fastq**.

After the above command is done running, you should see similar output on your screen as shown below.

```

```

If the command was successful, your current directory should contain two new files:

* `unmatched.in.R1.fastq`
* `unmatched.in.R2.fastq`

---

### Step 2: Classify reads against kraken database

Now that we have most, if not all, host reads filtered out, it’s time to classify the remaining reads.

Database selection is one of the most crucial parts of running Kraken. One of the many factors that must be considered are the computational resources available. Our current AWS image for the course has only 16G of memory. A major disadvantage of Kraken is that it loads the entire database into memory. With the full viral, bacterial, and archael database on the order of 100 GB we would be unable to run the full database on the course machine (though the recently released Kraken 2 has done a lot to reduce database size). To help mitigate this, Kraken allows reduced databases to be constructed, which will still give reasonable results. We have constructed our own miniture Kraken database for this course, though a downloadable version is also provided by the authors ([minikraken](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/kraken/dl/minikraken.tgz)).

Lets run the following command in our current directory to classify our reads against the kraken database.

```bash
kraken --paired --threads 4 --db ~/CourseData/IDGE_data/module6/kraken_db/ unmatched.in.R1.fastq unmatched.in.R2.fastq > results_initial.txt
```

After the above command is done running, you should see similar output on your screen as shown below.

```
110056 sequences (32.66 Mbp) processed in 22.528s (293.1 Kseq/m, 86.98 Mbp/m).
  90212 sequences classified (81.97%)
  19844 sequences unclassified (18.03%)
```

---

### Step 3: Generate text-based report using Kraken-report.

While this initial output file, `results_initial.txt`, is useful as input to some software, it is not really meant to be human readable. Lets convert this file to a human-readable format using `kraken-report`.

```bash
kraken-report --db ~/CourseData/IDGE_data/module6/kraken_db/ results_initial.txt > results_final.txt
```

Let’s look at the generated text report from Kraken-report by opening a web browser and navigate to **http://XX.oicrcbw.ca**, where XX is your student ID. You should be able to find and open the file `results_final.txt` in the following directory hierarchy `module6_exercises/ex1/`.

The output of `kraken-report` is easier to understand and interpret than the previous output we generated from Kraken (documeted [here](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/kraken/MANUAL.html#sample-report-output-format)). The number on the left indicates the percentage of reads assigned to the taxonomic category listed at the very right.

To summarize this information into a single interactive figure, we can use [Krona](https://github.com/marbl/Krona/wiki).

---
### Step 4: Generate interactive html-based report using Krona

To generate a Krona figure, we first must make a file, `krona_input.txt`, containing a list of read IDs and the taxonomic IDs these reads were assigned. We can then run `ktImportTaxonomy` to create the figure. To do this, please run the following commands.

```bash
cut -f2,3 results_initial.txt > krona_input.txt

ktImportTaxonomy krona_input.txt -o final_web_report.html
```

Let’s look at what Krona generated. Return to your web browser and refresh the page from Step 3 to see the new files added in the `~/workspace/module6_exercises/ex1` directory.

Click on **final_web_report.html**. *Note: if this is not working, what you should see is shown in the image [here](images/krona_ex1.png)*.

### Questions

*Note: Precomputed results are in `~/CourseData/IDGE_data/module6/example-outputs/ex1` if needed.*

1. Given the output of Krona (or the Kraken report), what do you hypothesize is causing the patient's illness?

## Exercise 2

### Background:

On April 24, a 5-year old female was admitted to a local ER. She presented with high fever, chills and enlarged lymph nodes. CBC revealed elevated white blood cell count, neutrophils, etc. The hospital epidemiologist was consulted to confirm the clinician's’ findings. 

### Demonstration:

* Filter host reads with KAT
* Run Kraken with small bacteria and viral database
* Generate text and graphic reports with Kraken and Krona
* Assemble reads and send to NCBI BLAST to check against additional database

---
### Step 1: Host read filtering

The first step in this demonstration is to remove the host reads from the dataset prior to downstream analyses.

```bash
cd ~/workspace/module6_exercises/ex2/

kat filter seq -i -o unmatched --seq ex2_1.fastq --seq2 ex2_2.fastq ~/CourseData/IDGE_data/module6/kat_db/human_kmers.jf
```

---
### Step 2: Classify reads against bacterial kraken database

Now let's classify our reads against the kraken database. Please make sure to include `--unclassified-out` as we will make use of this file.

```bash
kraken --paired --threads 4 --db ~/CourseData/IDGE_data/module6/kraken_db/ --unclassified-out unclassified.fasta unmatched.in.R1.fastq unmatched.in.R2.fastq > results_inital.txt
```

Let's also construct a text report and a Krona chart.

```bash
kraken-report --db ../../module_data/kraken_db/ results_initial.txt > results_final.txt

cut -f2,3 results_initial.txt > krona_input.txt

ktImportTaxonomy krona_input.txt -o final_web_report.html
```

Now we can take a look at the text report and Krona chart from `~/workspace/module6_exercises/ex2/` in the web browser.

![krona_ex2][images/krona_ex2.png]

Huh!? That's odd. It looks like ~90% of our reads are unclassified, even after removing human k-mers. These reads could all be sequencing artifacts, or they could indicate that the organism these reads belong to is not well-represented in our Kraken database (possibly even an emerging pathogen).

One option to get a bit more information about what's going on would be to use a larger Kraken database, but this requires a lot more computer resources. Another option is to try and assemble the unclassified reads (`unclassified.fasta`) with [SPAdes][] and see if we can make any sense of them. Let's try this option.

SPAdes normally operates on reads in fastq format (sequence data plus quality scores), but kraken outputs the unclassified reads in fasta format (no quality score information). Quality scores are useful for correcting possible errors in the reads, but we can still assemble reads into genomes without them and get reasonable results (assuming the reads already are relativly error-free). Let's do this now, disabling error correction with `--only-assembler`.

```
spades.py --only-assembler -s unclassified.fasta -o unclassified_results
```

The assembled genome will be located under `unclassified_results/contigs.fasta`. In order to get a better idea of what's in these files, let's run the assembled genome through [NCBI BLAST](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastSearch) and examine the matches (note, you can find and download the file by navigating through the filesystem in your web browser).

### Questions

*Note: Precomputed results are in `~/CourseData/IDGE_data/module6/example-outputs/ex2` if needed.*

1. Look through the matches for a few of the longest and highest-covered contigs in NCBI. Are there any matches that could tell you a bit more about what is responsible for the patient's illness?

   You can look through the results for different contigs in NCBI BLAST by using the drop-down menu shown below:

   ![blast-drop-down][images/blast-drop-down.png]

   The length and coverage of the contig is listed in the sequence id (e.g., `len_5000` for 5000 bp, `cov_5.15` for an average coverage of 5.15). The coverage gives an indication of how much data (how many reads) were used to assemble this contig.

   *Note: We specifically removed the organism you will find from the Kraken database for this workshop. This organism would be found by Kraken for the standard bacterial/viral databases, but emerging pathogens may not be found as easily.*
