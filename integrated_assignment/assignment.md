Public health workers suspect a Canada-wide foodborne disease outbreak of Salmonella has occurred. Whole genome sequencing was performed on Salmonella isolates collected from  patients, food sources, and environmental sources. Some patient isolates showed resistance to a common antibiotic; other patient isolates showed resistance to multiple antibiotics.  The genomic data and epidemiological metadata have been uploaded to the IRIDA platform at Simon Fraser University.  You are asked to perform phylogenomic analysis, phylogeographic analysis, and  temporospatial analysis on these sequences, and to interpret the results.  

What can you infer about the likelihood that one or more outbreaks have occurred? If you conclude that an outbreak has occurred, provide a hypothesis about how the outbreak occurred, including an identification of which isolates are outbreak associated, and which ones are sporadic. Can you provide a hypothesis that explains the observation of antibiotic resistance in the isolates collected from human sources?
